\chapter{stahler palla (43) - ISM }

\begin{itemize}
\item Galactic gas. HI: $E=\SI{13.6}{\ev}n\expy{-2}$: UV Lyman series $2\to1$-$\Lya$ (\SI{1216}{\angstrom}), $3\to1$-$\Lyb$ (\SI{1026}{\angstrom}), balmer serie-$3\to2$ ($\Ha$: \SI{6563}{\angstrom}). Hyperfine traansition from higher excited antiparallel e-spin and p-magnetic moment (some fraction of collisionally excited H deexcite through photon emission)
\end{itemize}

\chapter{stahler palla (267)- From clouds to stars}

\begin{itemize}
\item Molecular clouds (pg 71). 
\item Collapse is localized within lorge complexes - since most molecular gas is not collapsing we investigate equilibrium of forces under which clouds can last over long period
\item Equilibrium of thermal pressure and self-gravity: isothermal first approximation for dense core. Lane-Eden equation: gravitatonal stability and critical lenght scale using isothermal Lane-Emden model (for stable cloud increases of $P_0$ causes increase of internal pressure: clouds of low density constrast are confined by external pressure, all clouds with $\frac{\rho}{\rho_c}14.$ at right of first maximum are gravitationally unstable - $M_{BE}=\frac{m_1a_T^4}{P_0\expy{1/2}G\expy{3/2}}$). Jeans classics analysis of self-graviting waves propagating through unifprm medium: $\lambda_J=\sqrt{\frac{\pi c_s^2}{G\rho_0}}$ - dense core/Bok globe are close to Instability
\item rotation support. Dense cores have measured rotation rate (\SI{1.27}{\cm} line of $NH_3$ and others - ch3), and gradient in radial velocity from CO mapping of GMC. Cyl symm-sys specific AM about z $j=ou_{\phi}=r\sin\thetau_{\phi}$: centrifugal force per unit mass $j^2/o^3$ which have to be balanced in EOM, centrifugal potential $\Phi_{cen}=-\int_0^oj^2/o^3\,do$ so we can extendend the non rotating case. Numerical methods: trial density.
