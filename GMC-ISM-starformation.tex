\begin{itemize}
\item Collapse is localized within lorge complexes - since most molecular gas is not collapsing we investigate equilibrium of forces under which clouds can last over long period
\item Equilibrium of thermal pressure and self-gravity: isothermal first approximation for dense core. Lane-Eden equation: gravitatonal stability and critical lenght scale
\end{itemize}
