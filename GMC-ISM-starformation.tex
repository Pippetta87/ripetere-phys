\chapter{stahler palla (43) - ISM }

\begin{itemize}
\item Galactic gas. HI: $E=\SI{13.6}{\ev}n\expy{-2}$: UV Lyman series $2\to1$-$\Lya$ (\SI{1216}{\angstrom}), $3\to1$-$\Lyb$ (\SI{1026}{\angstrom}), balmer serie-$3\to2$ ($\Ha$: \SI{6563}{\angstrom}). Hyperfine traansition from higher excited parallel e-spin and p-magnetic moment (some fraction of collisionally excited H deexcite through photon emission) - convert column density to volume density require knowledge of location of emitting gas: overall shift in peak intensity steam for diff rotation of galaxy which is known thus analysis of emission profile in many directions yields number density $n_{HI}$; 21cm-absorption profile probes gas temperature. HI confined in clouds +warm unconfined component.
Molecular Gas: CO is strong emitter - molecular clouds optically thick to \SI{2.6}{\milli\meter} line (trace total $H_2$ in the cloud); $H_2$ distribution in galxy peaks at \SI{6}{\kilo\parsec} related to star formation and little outside \SI{10}{\kilo\parsec}, more confined to g-plane.
HII regions around O/B stars: stellar Lyman continuum ionized for several parsec - emission from heavier allow composition reconstruction / absorption from star behind HI cloud: HII of M42 Z depleted (segregated in dust).
Phases of atomic components: cooling (low density $\Lya$ line, higher density CII \SI{158}{\micro\meter} transition) heating (starlight causes \Pelectron emission from dust grains) terms determine T-eq (for \SI{1}{\per\cubic\cm} \SI{e4}{\kelvin}) what state matches known interstellare pressure?
\item Interstellar dust. Extinction $m_{\lambda}=M_{\lambda}+5\log{(\frac{r}{\SI{10}{\parsec}})}+A_{\lambda}$, color excess $E_{12}=A_{\lambda_1}-A_{\lambda_2}$ both proportional to column density of dust on LOS ($\frac{E_{\lambda-V}}{E_{B-V}}=\frac{A_{\lambda}}{E_{B-V}}-\frac{A_V}{E_{B-V}}=\frac{A_{\lambda}}{E_{B-V}}-R$), assuming $A\approx0$ for long wavelength.
$I_{\nu}\Delta\nu\Delta A\Delta\Omega$ is energy per unit time between $[\nu,\nu+\Delta\nu]$ propagating normal to area $\Delta A$ within $\Delta\Omega$n (flux across surface with normal $\hat{z}$ is energy per unit area per unit time $F_{\nu}=\int\mu I_{\nu}\,d\Omega$, $\mu=\hat{n}\cdot\hat{z}$ cosine between propagation direction and normal), total specific energy density $u_{\nu}$ and mean intensity $J_{\nu}$ - $\Delta I_{\nu}=-\rho\kappa_{\nu}I_{\nu}\Delta s+j_{\nu}\Delta s$; at $\lambda$ of negligible dust emssion $I_{\lambda}(r)=I_{\lambda}(R_*)\exp{-\Delta\tau_{\lambda}}$ and flux at r much greater than $R_*$ ($\mu\approx1$) and $\Delta\Omega=\pi\frac{R_*^2}{r^2}$: $F_{\lambda}=\pi I_{\lambda}(R_*)(\frac{R_*}{r})^2\exp{-\Delta\tau_{\lambda}}$ - $A_{\lambda}=2.5\log{e}\Delta\tau_{\lambda}$

\chapter{stahler palla (267)- From clouds to stars}

\begin{itemize}
\item Molecular clouds (pg 71). 
\item Collapse is localized within lorge complexes - since most molecular gas is not collapsing we investigate equilibrium of forces under which clouds can last over long period
\item Equilibrium of thermal pressure and self-gravity: isothermal first approximation for dense core. Lane-Eden equation: gravitatonal stability and critical lenght scale using isothermal Lane-Emden model (for stable cloud increases of $P_0$ causes increase of internal pressure: clouds of low density constrast are confined by external pressure, all clouds with $\frac{\rho}{\rho_c}14.$ at right of first maximum are gravitationally unstable - $M_{BE}=\frac{m_1a_T^4}{P_0\expy{1/2}G\expy{3/2}}$). Jeans classics analysis of self-graviting waves propagating through uniform medium: $\lambda_J=\sqrt{\frac{\pi c_s^2}{G\rho_0}}$ - dense core/Bok globe are close to Instability
\item rotation support. Dense cores have measured rotation rate (\SI{1.27}{\cm} line of $NH_3$ and others - ch3), and gradient in radial velocity from CO mapping of GMC. Cyl symm-sys specific AM about z $j=ou_{\phi}=r\sin\thetau_{\phi}$: centrifugal force per unit mass $j^2/o^3$ which have to be balanced in EOM, centrifugal potential $\Phi_{cen}=-\int_0^oj^2/o^3\,do$ so we can extendend the non rotating case. Numerical methods: trial density.
